    KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
    * Participated in the research program “EAST-CITIES: Establishing and Achieving Sustainability Targets in Eastern Chinese Cities”
    * Studied on the building materials and energy consumption of Qingdao industrial buildings

    GENERAL STEPS
    * Searched the literature and database and determined the main structure type of Qingdao industrial buildings (steel structure, steel-concrete composite structure), and its material consumption range and energy use form
    * Established the typical building models with Revit and energy simulation models with DesignBuilder
    * Simulated and analyzed the material use, energy consumption and CO2 emission of each typical building
    * Proposed a series of sustainable strategies for future industrial buildings

    INNOVATION
    * Established typical building models in different time periods under different energy-efficient standards, which have also affected the material use and energy consumption
    * Took foundation components into account

    OUTPUT
    * One abstract submitted to International Workshop on Health - Energy Efficiency & Intelligent Building Systems (HEIBS) to be hold in 2021
    * One inspired study on the application of rooftop PV systems in lightweight steel-structured industrial buildings, accepted by the conference Alternative & Renewable Energy Quest in Architecture and Urbanism (AREQ) in 2020

    GENERAL STEPS
    * Performed thermal performance measurement of an existing rural house
    * Analyzed the situation of residential buildings in rural area and the retrofitting feasibility
    * Developed a framework to choose the active-passive combined economically optimal retrofitting strategies for existing rural dwellings
    * Created a building model for the energy simulation with DesignBuilder and calibrated it with the 2-month environmental and energy monitoring
    * Analyzed 17 retrofitting external wall selections combined with a rooftop PV generation system
    * Figured out the optimal plan meeting the annual energy balance requirement with the lowest budget

    INNOVATION
    * Retrofitting framework considering the originality of rural construction and material, economic capacity and the limitation of regional regulations
    * Energy simulation model calibrated with energy and environmental monitoring data

    KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
    * Thermal transmittance measurement of external walls
    * Energy simulation modeling and calibration
    * Manuscript drafting and proofreading

    GENERAL INFORMATION OF C-HOUSE
    * A two-story lightweight steel-framed house which was completed and delivered within 20 days with the application of three-level component assembly technology
    * Combined the active energy “Core” and the passive energy-efficient envelope “Cube”

    KEY RESPONSIBILITIES
    * Recorded the installation and demolition phase of C-House, calculated the energy consumption during manufacturing, and also summarized the energy-efficient methods used in the building design and construction phase. (conference paper [4] published)
    * From the perspective of building components, proposed design methods of maintainable residential buildings, namely durability and replaceable design of building components, and independent design of component groups. (conference paper [5] published)
    * Discussed with German partners (designers of the Core) and summarized strategies of intelligent energy-plus house based on BIPV, especially the performance design during early design stage, the energy consumption-production method of HVAC system and PV system, and the smart energy control system.
